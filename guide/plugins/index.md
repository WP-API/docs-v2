title: Compatible Plugins & Tools
canonical_url: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/
---
The following is a list of plugins that utilize and are compatible with the WordPress REST API v2.
Some plugins may be more intended for development purposes and others for production environments. Code quality is also highly variant.
While [WordPress REST API v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) is still in plugin form, most of these plugins use it as a dependency,
as opposed to the core infrastructure introduced in WordPress 4.4, so make sure you have it installed and activated.

_The list may not represent every plugin and extension for the WP REST API v2
if you would like something to be added [please notify us](https://github.com/WP-API/docs-v2/issues/).
If you see a plugin you have authored here and we are not representing it correctly or would like it removed, feel free to make a GitHub issue as well._

**Disclaimer:** _Plugins and extensions found on this page are not condoned or endorsed by the WP REST API team._ This is a list for you to explore!
