Welcome to the API reference for the WordPress REST API! It's great to have you here.

The API is organized around [REST][]. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with the API from a client-side web application.

The API uses JSON exclusively as the request and response format, including error responses. It also uses the [HAL standard][] for linking, and is fully discoverable via hyperlinks in the responses.

The API provides public data accessable to any client anonymously, as well as private data only available after [authentication](/guide/authentication/). Most content management actions can be performed over the REST API, allowing you to build alternative dashboards for a site, enhance your plugins with more responsive management tools, as well as building single-page applications for a site.

This API reference provides information on what's available through the API, however common usage patterns and guides are available as part of the [general documentation](/).

Unlike many other REST APIs, the WordPress REST API is distributed and available individually on each site that supports it. This means there is no singular API root or base to contact; instead, we have [a discovery process](/guide/discovery/) that allows interacting with sites without prior contact. The API also exposes self-documentation at the index endpoint, or via an `OPTIONS` request to any endpoint, allowing human- or machine-discovery of endpoint capabilities.

We provide a [demo installation][demo] of the API for testing purposes at `https://demo.wp-api.org/wp-json/`; this site supports autodiscovery, and provides read-only demo data. (This documentation site is generated using the self-documentation from the demo site.)
